# Introduction
The English Wine Cellar is a B2C ecommerce retailer of English wines. In addition they sell glassware and provide wine tasting experiences to complement their core product offering.

In the past, English wine was thought of as being below the standards of European wines and those from warmer climes, as England didn't have the required climate or expertise.

All of this has changed in recent years, partly due to customer perception and the emphasis on buying local by ethically minded consumers in order to contribute to a healthy environment.

Britains changing climate and knowledgeable winemakers has meant that the UK can now produce good wine and compete with their continental neighbours.
