# Introduction
The English Wine Cellar is an online retailer of English wines and wine accessories. They also provide wine tasting experiences to compliment their core business.

### The Emergence of the British Wine Industry
In the past, English wine was thought of as being below the standards of European wines and those from warmer climes, as England didn't have the required climate or expertise.

This has changed in recent years, partly due to customer perception and the emphasis on 'buying local' by ethically minded consumers in order to contribute to a healthy environment.

Britain's changing climate and knowledgeable winemakers has meant that the UK can now compete with their continental neighbours in regard to producing good quality wine.

However, Britain cannot, at present, produce the quantities to match those from other major wine producing regions. The lower yield and supply of British wines, means that the cost to the end consumer will be high.

The business' target audience have the following attributes:

- Mid 30s - late 40s
- Professional
- High disposable income (money no object)
- Enjoy finer things in life

### Problem Statement
The number of outlets for English wines are smaller in number than the imported wines from other regions. This is due to the emergence of the home grown product being a relative new entrant to market and low quantities produced. This is not a mass market product, but quite niche in that it is defined by quality and price. Availability is limited to high end outlets and direct from the winemakers/vineyards.

### Site Owner's Goal

- Promote English wines, educate potential customers and encourage repeat business.
